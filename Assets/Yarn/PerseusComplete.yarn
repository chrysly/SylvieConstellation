Perseus: You-! You can restore Constellations!
Sylvie: I can? OH! I CAN!
Perseus: Fascinating... I've never heard of a constellation with such power. Who are you?
Sylvie: Me? I'm Sylvie... I think.
Perseus: Interesting. Your power can do some much needed help here.
Perseus: Tell you what. Go visit Lyra over in the Lovers Nebula. She might be able to help you.
Perseus: (It's too dangerous. But their power... Maybe it is possible...)
